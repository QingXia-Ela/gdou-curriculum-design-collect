1.	Definitions:  Licensed Program means whichever features of the 
software are enabled by the software protection mechanism corresponding to 
the configuration you have licensed.  Software means any of the software 
provided under this Agreement on DVD, via a web-site, or on another medium 
or through another delivery mechanism, including any non-subscribed or 
unenabled features thereof, any intellectual property (IP) megafunctions 
or components provided with the software, except as noted in this paragraph, 
and any associated user documentation; excepting the portions identified in 
particular files which components are subject to the applicable license 
agreement(s) set forth therein.  Intellectual property (IP) megafunctions or 
components means one or one or more design files, including encrypted net lists, 
RTL, test vectors, simulation models (such as VHDL, Verilog HDL, Quartus 
simulation, Matlab, Simulink, Verisity Specman, Synopsys Vera, etc.), and other 
models, which may be provided either as unencrypted source code, obfuscated 
source code or in encrypted netlist or encrypted source code format, that are 
designed to implement or support the design of at least one logic function into 
an Altera Device.  IP megafunctions or components include any updates thereto or 
modified versions thereof as may be provided by Altera, in its sole and absolute 
discretion, to you under this Agreement.  IP megafunctions or components, as

or FAR. Contractor/manufacturer is Altera Corporation, 101 Innovation Drive, 
San Jose, CA 95134 and its licensors.

9. TalkBack Feature Notice :  The TalkBack feature, included with the 
Licensed Program(s), enables ALTERA to receive limited information 
concerning the Licensed Program(s) that you use and your compilation of 
logic designs (but not the logic design files themselves) using the 
Licensed Program(s).  One of the primary purposes of the TalkBack feature 
is to assist ALTERA in understanding how its customers use the Licensed 
Program(s) and ALTERA’S other products, so more effort can be placed on 
improving the features most important to users.  To disable/enable the 
TalkBack feature, run qtb_install.exe located in your quartus/bin folder.

INFORMATION COLLECTED
The only information that ALTERA will receive through the TalkBack feature 
is the information listed below.  No design files will be collected or 
transmitted through the TalkBack feature.  

Logic design compilation information regarding the following categories will 
be collected: constraints (e.g., location assignments, clock and timing 
requirement and assignments, any constraints set via the Quartus? II 
graphical user interface), device (e.g., targeted device and family), 
compilation (e.g., device, memory and I/O utilization, time of compilation), 
design (e.g., the number of each type of file used and name of top file, 
intellectual property cores/Megacore® logic functions used), software tools 
(e.g., synthesis, simulation and timing analysis tools used and version and 
build of the Licensed Program(s)), platform (e.g., operating system, speed 
and number of processors and main memory), license file identification number 
(T-Guard, host ID, NIC ID or C: drive), graphical user interface activities 
and software errors log (e.g., previous exit status).

TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION
The TalkBack feature functions by bundling the collected information 
resulting from your installation and/or execution of the Licensed Program(s) 
and each logic design compilation and writing it to XML files which are 
transmitted to ALTERA’S external web server by https (hypertext transfer 
protocol secure) post.  

The TalkBack feature will only maintain up to fifteen (15) files at any 
given time, i.e., the last five (5) sent files and up to ten (10) unsent 
files.  As new files are created, prior files (whether or not previously 
transmitted) will be deleted.  Each saved file will be less than 500 KB in 
size and can be viewed as text files found in your temporary directory on 
your hard drive (typically in /tmp, c:/temp, or c:\documents and setting\
username\local settings\temp).

If an https post transmission fails, or an internet connection is not 
available at the time of installation, execution or compilation, the 
information is stored as an XML file.  Once an internet connection is 
achieved by you, the https post transmission will again be attempted upon 
a successful compilation.  The TalkBack feature will not initiate an 
internet connection.  Files that have not been successfully transmitted 
will be named “quartus_talkback*.xml”, while successfully transmitted files 
will be renamed as “sent_quartus_talkback*.xml.”  

The collection and bundling of information by the TalkBack feature will 
not materially affect the installation, compilation time or the performance 
of the Licensed Program(s).

ALTERA uses reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the transmitted 
information.  However, due to technological limitations, and the risk of 
unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, ALTERA 
cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that the 
information will be absolutely protected or confidential.  Once received, 
the transmitted information is protected from outside ALTERA by “firewalls.”  

Should you attempt to tamper with or modify any installation of the Licensed 
Program(s) in any way (other than as permitted herein or by your license), 
ALTERA does not take any responsibility regarding the operation of the 
TalkBack feature, or the collection and transmission of data as described 
herein.

NON-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED; USE OF INFORMATION
The information collected by the TalkBack feature will not be disclosed by 
ALTERA to any third parties other than its subsidiaries and the company on 
behalf of whom you are using the Quartus II software (collectively, Partners).  
Once the collected data is received by ALTERA within their firewall, ALTERA 
may correlate the data collected by the TalkBack feature to determine the 
identity of the user and utilize this information internally only on a 
confidential basis.   ALTERA also seeks to require its Partners to exercise 
reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the information.   

The information collected by the TalkBack feature will only be used by 
ALTERA and its Partners for marketing and sales research , product planning 
and software development purposes (for example, solving software problems, 
optimizing software processing and designing future products to your needs).    
This information will not be used to send you any sales and marketing 
communications, and ALTERA will only send you such information if you have 
previously provided your consent to receive such communications.  If you do 
not wish to receive sales and marketing communications, you may contact 
webmaster@altera.com.  In that case, we will use reasonable efforts to 
promptly remove you from such lists. 

EUROPEAN USERS OF THE LICENSED PROGRAM(S): Please note that the TalkBack 
feature will collect and provide certain personally identifiable information 
to ALTERA.  By agreeing to this Program Subscription License Agreement, you 
hereby give your consent for ALTERA to use this information both within and 
outside of the European Union for the purposes described in this TalkBack 
disclosure notice.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION BY ISPS
Through the https post procedure, your and ALTERA’s Internet Service 
Providers will also receive the information collected by the TalkBack 
feature.  However, ALTERA’S ISP does not disclose, share, release, publish, 
disseminate, rent or sell any of the information to any third parties. You 
should contact your ISP to determine their disclosure policies.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURES
In addition to the permitted disclosures described herein, and regardless of 
anything herein to the contrary, ALTERA may disclose personally identifiable 
information (collected by the TalkBack feature and correlated to users), with 
or without prior notice, when ALTERA believes that the law requires it, in 
response to subpoenas or at the demand of governmental agencies, to protect 
its systems or business, or to respond to an emergency.  

ASSIGNMENT
ALTERA reserves the right to transfer any and all information collected by 
the TalkBack feature from users of the Licensed Program(s) to a third party 
in the event that it sells or transfers substantially all of its assets 
related to the Licensed Program(s) to such third party.

DISABLING/ENABLING
You may disable/enable the TalkBack feature at any time by running 
qtb_install.exe located in your quartus/bin folder.

5. PERL (EXECUTABLE) [FOR USE WITH QUARTUS II ONLY]:
[include zip file of source code in order to comply with license terms for 
distribution of executable]

The following terms only apply to the Perl scripting tool portions of the 
Quartus II development tool (the Standard Version of the executables and 
library files are being made available in a zip file in source format within 
this package, or they can be obtained from www.cpan.org):

Copyright (C) 1991-2001 Larry Wall

Preamble
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package 
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of 
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the 
users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a 
more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable 
modifications. 

Definitions
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright 
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual 
modification. 

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, 
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder 
as specified below. 

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for 
the package. 

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media 
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will 
not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the 
computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though 
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients 
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 

You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard 
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all 
of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 

You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 

You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that 
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you 
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

	place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such 
as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. 
	use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
	rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it 
differs from the Standard Version. 
	make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, 
provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

       distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to 
get the Standard Version. 
       accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
Package with your modifications.
	give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly 
document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with 
instructions on where to get the Standard Version. 
       make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. 
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not 
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this 
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of 
a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do 
not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this 
Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall 
be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete 
Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded. 

The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output 
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the 
copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may 
be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such 
scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called 
"undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then 
distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution 
of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 
and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a 
Standard Version of this Package. 

C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) 
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines 
and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be 
considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in 
Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any 
way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 

Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always 
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when 
no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the 
end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed 
as a distribution of this Package. 

The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this software without specific prior written 
permission. 

THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)


These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.


  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

OVERVIEW
========

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
with various compression settings.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.

We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.


LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.  It
is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

WARNING: Unisys has begun to enforce their patent on LZW compression against
GIF encoders and decoders.  You will need a license from Unisys to use the
included rdgif.c or wrgif.c files in a commercial or shareware application.
At this time, Unisys is not enforcing their patent against freeware, so
distribution of this package remains legal.  However, we intend to remove
GIF support from the IJG package as soon as a suitable replacement format
becomes reasonably popular.

We are required to state that

REFERENCES
==========

We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
understand the innards of the JPEG software.

The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article
is available at ftp.uu.net, graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and
IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson, published by M&T Books (Redwood
City, CA), 1991, ISBN 1-55851-216-0.  This book provides good explanations and
example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is
an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much
about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from
industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation,
you've got one here...

The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1
and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG
in existence, and we highly recommend it.

The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a
paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified
official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)
In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)
642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of
1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1
is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

Extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a new ISO
document.  Part 3 is undergoing ISO balloting and is expected to be approved
by the end of 1995; it will have document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-3, ITU-T
T.84.  IJG currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.

The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
	Literature Department
	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
	1778 McCarthy Blvd.
	Milpitas, CA 95035
	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
A PostScript version of this document is available at ftp.uu.net, file
graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  It can also be obtained by e-mail from the C-Cube
mail server, netlib@c3.pla.ca.us.  Send the message "send jfif_ps from jpeg"
to the server to obtain the JFIF document; send the message "help" if you have
trouble.

The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from sgi.com
(192.48.153.1), file graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.Z; or you can order a printed
copy from Aldus Corp. at (206) 628-6593.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from sgi.com or
from ftp.uu.net:/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision of
the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available
from sgi.com:/graphics/tiff/.


ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
=================

The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found
there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived
as graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz.  If you are on the Internet, you
can retrieve files from ftp.uu.net by standard anonymous FTP.  If you don't
have FTP access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.

Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only
ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.

You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from
the SimTel archives (ftp.coast.net:/SimTel/msdos/graphics/), or on CompuServe
in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 "JPEG Tools".
Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.

The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of
general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is
not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to
Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
You can always obtain the latest version from the news.answers archive at
rtfm.mit.edu.  By FTP, fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1 and
.../part2.  If you don't have FTP, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with body
	send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1
	send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2


RELATED SOFTWARE
================

Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a
few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists
some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to
obtain them on Internet.

If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
PBMPLUS image software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format
image files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide
range of other formats.  You can obtain this package by FTP from ftp.x.org
(contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z) or ftp.ee.lbl.gov (pbmplus*.tar.Z).  There is also
a newer update of this package called NETPBM, available from
wuarchive.wustl.edu under directory /graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software
is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.

A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
is available from havefun.stanford.edu in directory pub/jpeg.  This program
is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;
it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it
is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
which we do not.


FILE FORMAT WARS
================

Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.
The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a
concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,
creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none
of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to
exchange compressed files.)

The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format
has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has
become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF
Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of
additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely
supported, unfortunately.

The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should
be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical
advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an
official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear
whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto
standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we
have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)

Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.
We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,
one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't
use a proprietary file format!


TO DO
=====

In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file
format.

Tuning the software for better behavior at low quality/high compression
settings is also of interest.  The current method for scaling the
quantization tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.

As always, speeding things up is high on our priority list.

Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.
